# NOTES

### Basic rules to check stages of Cell Cycle

1. START of cell division (end of stationary G1) requires Cln3
2. G1 requires Cln3 to be deactivated and MBF, SBF to be activated
3. G1 to S requires activation of Clb5,6
4. G2 requires activation of Clb1,2
5. Entering M phase is indicated by activation of Cdc20, 14
6. Exit from M to G1 phase is indicated by deactivation of the same Cyclins
