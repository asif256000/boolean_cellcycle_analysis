"""
JAX-accelerated state calculation module for boolean cell cycle analysis.

This module provides optimized methods for state calculations using JAX,
which can significantly speed up the processing of large state spaces.
Key features include:

1. Automatic GPU/CPU detection and configuration
2. Dynamic batch size optimization based on model complexity
3. Memory-efficient vectorized operations
4. JIT compilation for faster execution
5. Graceful fallback to standard Python implementation if JAX is not available

Performance notes:
- For small models (< 8 cyclins), performance gain may be modest
- For medium models (8-12 cyclins), expect 5-20x speedup with GPU
- For large models (13+ cyclins), expect 20-100x speedup with GPU
- Memory usage is optimized through batched processing
