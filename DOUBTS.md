# Doubts

### 31st October, 2022

- [ ] Need to make green edges differently from red edges?
- [ ] Will our model take time into consideration or use similar tactic as the paper?
- [ ] Pds1 not present in Fig 1B. Even though the checkpoint is gone, will the other Cyclins not affect Pds1?
- [ ] Why is Cdc20 and Cdc14 clubbed together?
- [ ] Significance of self-degradation loops?
- [ ] What does total input mean in self-degradation model? Is it Sum of all `aij*Sj(t)` for any j (refer formula)?
- [ ] General question: Does the presence and absence of a protein cause the generation or death of another set of proteins in the cell cycle?
- [ ] What is attractor of a state?
- [ ] Why are we taking the blue arrow as the highway, not any other arrows that are creating the way?
- [ ] Is any other peer working on the same project?
- [ ] What will be the format of the data?
